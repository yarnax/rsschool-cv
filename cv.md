## About myself ##
I always wanted to develop games. In my childhood these was some self-hand-drawn table or _talking-rpg-style_ games (i didnt know by that time that DDO table RPGs or CCG is already existed). Later, when I discovered PC games for myself - I decided that someday I **will** make my own computer game. Years had passed... I tried some game constructors and always had feeling that they can not fulfill my needs about making something special in game. I have a technical point of view on games and like things to be in order when I approach to development. I love to learn something new and this how I came here. I expect that Front-end development will be my entry point to IT industry.
