                <h2>About myself</h2>
                <p>I always wanted to develop games. In my childhood these was some 
                    self-hand-drawn table or <em>talking-rpg-style</em> games (i didnt know by 
                    that time that DDO table RPGs or CCG is already existed). Later, when 
                    I discovered PC games for myself - I decided that someday I <strong>will</strong> 
                    make my own computer game. Years had passed... I tried some game 
                    constructors and always had feeling that they can not fulfill my needs 
                    about making something special in game. I have a technical point of view
                    on games and like things to be in order when I approach to development.
                    I love to learn something new and this how I came here. I expect that
                    Front-end development will be my entry point to IT industry.</p>
